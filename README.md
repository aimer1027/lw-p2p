Lightweight Peer-to-Peer framework based on Netty 4.x

Presently under construction, first working version expected for June 2015.

The framework aims to provide an easy-to-use peer to peer interface to use for server-less applications. It includes both TCP
and UDP connections. The framework is being built to fit with a libGDX multiplayer game.
